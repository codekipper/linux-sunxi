BRANCHING STRATEGY FOR SUNXI DEVELOPMENT
========================================

Always try to rebase upstream to linux-next.

If a delivery requires a specific branch then add the remote to this list
and add it as a temp branch.

SUNXI-WIP - development branch for everything
|\
| SUNXI-WIP-A64 - development branch for a64 incase SUNXI-WIP doesn't work
|/
PATCHES READY FOR DELIVERY BUT REQUIRING 3RD PARTY DELIVERIES TO ME MERGED
(including an updated version of this document)
|
3RD PARTY PATCHES (See note)
|
UPSTREAM - Patches ready for pushing (always rebase first)
|
LINUX-NEXT

THIRD PARTY PATCHES
===================

The patches below this point come from elsewhere, some as destined
for mainline whereas others are hacks. Here you will find some
notes on from where these patches come from. They may not be the
latest.
